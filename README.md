# adocers

Render AsciiDoc documents to HTML from the command line.

Parsing is done by [`asciidoc-parser`](https://github.com/asciidoc-rs/asciidoc-parser).
Diagnostics are drawn against the source with
[`ariadne`](https://codeberg.org/zesterer/ariadne). The command line is
[`clap`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap).

## Usage

```
adocers [OPTIONS] <FILE>...
```

Each input is rendered to a sibling `.html` file:

```
adocers doc.adoc            # writes doc.html
adocers -o build/ *.adoc    # writes build/<name>.html for each input
adocers -o - doc.adoc       # writes to standard output
```

### Options

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-o, --output <PATH>` | A file, a directory, or `-` for standard output. Several inputs require a directory. |
| `--fragment` | Emit only the body content — no page, no `#header`/`#footer`, no `#content` wrapper — for embedding in another page. |
| `--css <FILE>` | Embed this stylesheet instead of the built-in one. |
| `--no-css` | Emit the page unstyled. |
| `-a, --attribute <NAME[=VALUE]>` | Set a document attribute. `NAME`, `NAME=VALUE`, `NAME!` and `!NAME` all work, and the document cannot override them. Repeatable. |
| `--safe-mode <MODE>` | `unsafe` (default), `safe`, `server` or `secure`. Anything above `unsafe` confines `include::` to the document's own directory. |
| `-w, --watch` | Re-render on change; see below. |
| `--deny-warnings` | Exit non-zero if any warning was reported. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Also show low-severity (debug) diagnostics. |
| `-q, --quiet` | Report nothing. |
| `--color <WHEN>` | `auto` (default), `always` or `never`. |

## Diagnostics

Parsing AsciiDoc never fails — every UTF-8 string is a valid document — so
everything the parser has to say is a warning with a source span:

```
[UnterminatedDelimitedBlock] Warning: closing marker for delimited block not found
    ╭─[ doc.adoc:14:1 ]
    │
 14 │ ----
    │ ──┬─
    │   ╰─── closing marker for delimited block not found
────╯
```

Warnings never stop a render; the HTML is written regardless. Use
`--deny-warnings` to fail the run instead.

Spans are shown against the *preprocessed* source — the document after
`include::` expansion — which is what the parser measured, so the underline
always lands on the right bytes. When a warning came from an included file, a
note names the file and line it really came from.

## Watch mode

`--watch` renders every input once, then re-renders a document whenever it, or
any file it included, changes. The dependency set is recorded during each
render, so an `include::` added to a document is watched from the next pass
onward, even if it lives in a directory nothing was watching before.

Directories are watched rather than individual files, which survives the
rename-into-place that most editors use to save. Events are debounced by 200 ms
so a single save produces a single render. A failed render is reported and the
session continues.

## HTML output

The back end follows Asciidoctor's HTML5 converter — the same wrapper `div`s and
class names — so stylesheets written for Asciidoctor apply unchanged. A
standalone page carries a small built-in stylesheet that honours the reader's
light/dark preference.

`asciidoc-parser` renders inline content only; block and document assembly is
this tool's own back end (`src/render/`).

### Security

The HTML renderer is not an HTML sanitizer, and AsciiDoc deliberately lets a
document emit raw HTML through passthroughs and attribute substitution. If you
render untrusted AsciiDoc and serve the result to other people, run it through a
sanitizer such as [`ammonia`](https://crates.io/crates/ammonia) first. Safe mode
does not address this — it governs how far a document may reach outside itself,
not what it may put on the page.
